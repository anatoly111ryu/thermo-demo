## Known Issues

* Fullscreen Video: The full screen video playback on the LoginScreen isn't working for some strange reason. It was working while developing up until I published to Expo. I also rebooted my machine around the same time, but usually that fixes things rather than breaks them. So, hmmm... need to figure that out. Even more strange is that it played on one of my work colleague's phones (Android), so it's not even consistently broken.
* Victory chart: on the RevenueScreen is not constrained to the viewable container, nor is it centered.
